# Project Name
Space-Book

# Overview
This is a full stack application for Nashville Software School demonstrating CRUD with different relationships, such as one-to-many and many-to-many. It also uses a database set up with PostgreSQL with minimal api calls that I created using C# in order to execute many different features inside the application.
